# HTML Template 1
I created this template to be used as a boiler plate for different aspects of coding a website. 

## Table of contents
* [General info](#general-info)
* [Technologies](#technologies)

## General Info
It's easy to forget the basics and move on to the newest technology. With that stated, this template is created with HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. I also used AOS from NPM to assist with some of the UI/UX. This is one of a few templates I will create to show and work on different aspects of my coding along with my UI/UX design for a website. I also hope that those that are reading this feel free to use this for your own coding and UI/UX practice.
